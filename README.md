# ImageViewer

- Simple application that allows you to open and view images.

Originally, it was created to replace default Windows photo-viewer with long launch time and a lot of unnecessary functions (in my honest opinion).
It works fine, but of course can be improved in a lot of ways.

Implementaion: Qt 5.15.0 - MinGW32, C++.
